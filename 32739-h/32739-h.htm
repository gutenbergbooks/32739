<h1>Probability</h1>

<h2>By Louis Trimble</h2>

<h3>Illustration by Ed Emsh</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first time this little guy
comes in I'm new on the job.
He looks around as if he's scared
a prohibition agent will pop out of
the walls and bite him. Then he
gets up his nerve and sidles to the
bar. His voice is as thin as the rest
of him.</p>

<p>"Glass of beer."</p>

<p>I draw. He drinks and pays and
goes out.</p>

<p>That keeps on, Monday through
Friday at five-ten p.m., year in and
year out. He slips in, peers around,
has his beer, and pops out. Even in
'33, when we become legitimate, he
acts the same way&mdash;scared of his
shadow. Except he isn't big enough
to have a shadow.</p>

<p>During the war, when we're rationed,
I save him his daily glass.
He never fails to come in except
for two weeks every summer when
he's on vacation. From 1922 to
1953 he drinks one daily beer.</p>

<p>In thirty-one years, he and I
grow older together, and after the
first ten he talks a little so that over
a period of time I manage to learn
something about him. That first
day he'd come in, he was on his
first job out of college. Well, so was
I, only I went to bartending school
to learn how to mix prohibition
liquor. But even so, it gave us
something in common, and when
he learned we had started life together&mdash;as
he put it&mdash;he talked a
little more.</p>

<p>His name is Pettis. Six months
after I learn that, I get his first
name. It's Rabelais, and I could
see why he doesn't like it. But when
he breaks down and tells me, he
gets real bold and says:</p>

<p>"And what's yours, my male
Hebe?"</p>

<p>"Mike Murphy."</p>

<p>"Naturally," he said. He laughs.
It is the only time I hear him
laugh in thirty-one years. I can't see
anything funny.</p>

<p>He is a draftsman for those old
skinflints Cartner and Dillson.
When they die, their sons take over
and are even worse. In the depression,
Pettis gets a little shabby but
he always has the price of a glass
of beer. In '53 he's at the same
desk and doing the same job he
started on in '22.</p>

<p>In '35 he gets married. He tells
me so. Tasting his beer, he says,
"I'll be married this time tomorrow."
I often wonder what his wife
looks like but I never see her. Not
even when it gets decent for ladies
to come in, she never shows. Marriage
doesn't seem to change him;
he never looks happier or less shabby
or less browbeat.</p>

<p>In '42 I heard his first complaint.
By then we're both getting into
our forties and, what with his lack
of size and caved-in chest and my
insides all busted up from pre-World
War I football, the army
doesn't want us. So he never
misses a day except on his vacation.</p>

<p>He says, "I can't get raw materials."
About three months later,
I understand what he means when
he says, "My hobby is inventing."</p>

<p>In '45 I ask him, "What do you
invent?"</p>

<p>It takes him two years to decide
to tell me. By now we are pretty
good pals. He never tells anyone
else that I know of. He says, "I
invent machines. Super machines."</p>

<p>In '48 he says, "But they don't
work. Someday...."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>And in '53, on the day of our
thirty-first anniversary, you
might say, he comes in and things
are different. All different. I can
feel it when he opens the door and
comes in at five-o-nine instead of
five-ten. There is plenty more different,
too. He walks up to the bar
like it's his and roars:</p>

<p>"Two beers, Mike!"</p>

<p>I drop a glass I'm so surprised,
but I give him two beers like he
wants. He gulps them both down,
puts a foot on the rail and looks
me straight in the eye. His eyes are
a sort of washed blue. I've never
noticed them before.</p>

<p>"Beer for the house!" he yells at
me.</p>

<p>"Take it easy, Mr. Pettis," I says.</p>

<p>"Easy, hell!" he shouts and slaps
a roll as big as his hand on the bar.
"And call me Rabelais, Mike.
We're pals, aren't we?"</p>

<p>"You bet," I assures him. And I
mean it. Not because of the dough.
That makes me sweat. I can't figure
where this little guy gets such a
wad. And good money, too.</p>

<p>He sets them up three times. By
now he's feeling fine. I suggest he
get going before he misses the last
train home.</p>

<p>"I already missed it," he says
proudly. "And I'm not going home.
Let the old battle-axe really have
something to complain about. Beer,
Mike!"</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a way I hate to see it, but then
I figure a man has a right to let
off a little steam once every thirty-one
years. Even so, I get a little
worried when he asks for the phone
and calls up his wife.</p>

<p>He says, "Myrtle, this Rabelais.
Rabelais, your husband, you old
sow." He takes a breath and says,
"You're damned right I'm drunk.
And I'm staying that way. Go
home to your mother.... Oh yes,
you are. You're leaving on the
12:05 tomorrow and you'll eat
chicken a la king on the train and
fall asleep at Holt's Corner and
snore all the way home. And your
mother will be mad because her
left fender will get dented on the
way to the station." Bang! He
hangs up.</p>

<p>"Beer, Mike."</p>

<p>"Now look, Mr.&mdash;Rabelais&mdash;"</p>

<p>He ignores me. "Mike, who owns
this place?"</p>

<p>I don't, but I'd like to. I tell him
who my boss is and he hunts him
up in the phone book and calls him.
He says, "This is Rabelais Pettis.
I want to buy your Fifth Avenue
Tavern. How much?... Sold!"</p>

<p>And so help me, the boss comes
down and Rabelais hauls bills from
every pocket and lays it on the bar
in a great big pile. Then he has
the boss sign the place over to me.
Me, Mike Murphy. I figure tomorrow
when he wakes up broke
I'll have to give it back. But tonight
I own it. I'm real proud.</p>

<p>But I don't get to enjoy it. He
says, "Mike, let's do the town."
Can you refuse a guy who just
gives you a thirty thousand dollar
property? We do the town. We do
the girl shows, and he yells at all
the dames and tries to date the
usherettes until we finally get
pitched out. We get pitched out of
five before I steer him to a hash
house.</p>

<p>"Phooey," he says. "We'll go to
the Buster for a steak." That's our
fanciest place where the food starts
at ten dollars. We have two of the
biggest steaks I ever saw with
champagne and stuff, and so help
me, when Rabelais tries to date the
floor show girls, instead of getting
pitched out, we walk out with two
of the cutest kids I ever hope to
see. Only they're young enough to
be our daughters or maybe grand-daughters
even.</p>

<p>Rabelais is big hearted if not big
in any other way. He says to his
kid, a redhead a foot taller than
he, "Do you have a fur coat?"</p>

<p>"No, Rabelais." She learns fast
that he likes the name now.</p>

<p>"Ha," he says. "Then we'll get
some."</p>

<p>"In the summer?" I asks.</p>

<p>"We'll make it winter," Rabelais
says. "I'm tired of summer. Besides
in '56 there's a new bar in
town and it's a pip."</p>

<p>Now the three of us are halfway
sober and we just look at each
other and shrug. But Rabelais acts
and talks normal enough. He calls
a cab and has us hauled to an old
cottage in the suburbs. He waves
the cabby off with a twenty dollar
bill. When we go inside, he points
across the way. "I live there. This
is my secret laboratory."</p>

<p>We think he is kidding us some
more because there isn't anything
but dust and cobwebs in the place.
But he takes us to the basement
and there is a whole mess of junk
lying around. There are bars and
gears and wires and some stuff that
doesn't make any sense at all. It
has cobwebs and dust on it too.</p>

<p>"My super machines," he says.
"They don't work."</p>

<p>The redhead looks a little as if
she thinks he's nuts. But what can
she do? Already he's given her a
hundred dollar bill just for fun.</p>

<p>"But," he says, leading us into
another room, "this one does work."</p>

<p>There isn't anything in the room
but a big metal plate on the floor
with a wooden bench on it and
levers and rods in front of the
bench. "Climb on," Rabelais says.</p>

<p>We sit on the bench to humor
him and he pulls one lever as far
left as he can, then another a little
ways, then another, and a fourth.
Then he twists a rod to the right.
The lights go out and a cold draft
of air comes in through a window.
When the lights come on the air is
still cold. The girls are shivering.</p>

<p>"Three p.m., January 12, 1956,"
says Rabelais. "Let's go get fur
coats."</p>

<p>So we go out the way we came
in and it's daylight. And there's
snow on the ground. The cottage
is the same but the street is a highway
now. Rabalais hails the fanciest
looking cab I ever see and we get
driven to town where he buys all
of us fur coats in a store I never
heard of. Then we go to a dinner
club that makes the Buster look
like a greasy spoon. None of us
can say a word.</p>

<p>After he pays the check, Rabelais
says, "I'm short of cash. Let's go to
the bank."</p>

<p>"Banks ain't open," I remind
him.</p>

<p>"Mine is," he says and makes a
phone call. Pretty soon a big fancy
limousine with a chauffeur drives
up and we all pile in. I manage to
balk long enough to buy a newspaper.
Sure enough, the date is
January 12, 1956.</p>

<p>We go to the financial section
and right past my tavern. It's all
lighted up and fancy looking and
there's a big sign saying, "MIKE'S"
outside.</p>

<p>Rabelais says, "You're making a
mint, Mike."</p>

<p>"I see," I agrees, dazed. Rabelais
flicks the paper with a silly grin
and tells me to look on page four.
I do and there's an editorial beside
a cartoon of me, pot belly and all,
and it says, "Mayor Mike Murphy
agrees to run for Congress...."</p>

<p>"Me?"</p>

<p>"You," says Rabelais. "You make
it, too, Mike."</p>

<p>Before I can answer, we stop at
a building lighted up. Over the
door it says, "Pettis." That's all.
It's his, the whole building. And
it's full of offices. He shows me one
where his former bosses are slaving
over drafting boards. The bank
part is closed but some slavies are
working late as people in banks always
do and we go in and Rabelais
gets a wad of money and we leave.</p>

<p>It goes on like that. I'm ashamed
to say we get sort of looped and the
next thing we know we're in Paris
and having a fine time. Then we
take another flier on his machine
and it's summer. We enjoy that for
a while and then try another season.
It goes on that way for a couple
weeks. Once we accept the fact
that we're traveling in time, it's
easy.</p>

<p>But Rabelais, even when he's
looped, won't take us into the past
or far into the future. He just says,
"We have to watch probability,
Mike."</p>

<p>I don't get the idea but it doesn't
seem to matter much. We're having
too good a time kicking around in
the near future. Finally when we
all feel ready for a Keeley cure,
Rabelais takes us home. We land
in the basement at the very moment
we left it but with our fur coats and
fancy luggage and souvenirs. Rabelais
looks over all the gadgets we
have and those that are too much
ahead of our time, he throws away.</p>

<p>In a taxi heading for town, I
smoke my dollar cigar. I'm happy.
The girls are quiet, a little sad.</p>

<p>"It was fun," the redhead sighs.
"Kicking won't seem the same."</p>

<p>"Quit that kind of work," Rabelais
says. "Go to college or something."
And he hands each of them
a big wad of money.</p>

<p>Downtown we split up, each of
us going off somewhere to get the
rest we need. I sleep around the
clock and a little more. When I
wake up I'm the owner of a tavern
still, so I figure I'm to be mayor in
'54 and congressman in '56. It's a
wonderful life for a while. The
only thing is that I miss Rabelais
coming in at five-ten for his beer.</p>

<p>In '54 I get elected Mayor like
he said. My business gets remodelled
and all is swell.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Then one night I go to sleep
in my new house and I wake
up in the middle of the night feeling
a cold draft. When I turn over
I roll onto a lump in the mattress
and I know it was all a dream and
I'm Mike Murphy, bartender,
again.</p>

<p>The next a.m. I pick up the paper
and it's the summer of '53, the
day of Rabelais and my thirty-first
anniversary and I'm back at the old
stand. It was a fine dream, I says,
and go to work.</p>

<p>At five-o-nine, though, I can't
help looking at the clock. And sure
enough, Rabelais comes in, walks
up to the bar like he owns it and
roars at me, "Two beers, Mike!"</p>

<p>I can't help saying, "Look,
haven't we done this before?"</p>

<p>He grins at me. "And we may
have to do it again a few times," he
says.</p>

<p>By now I know him pretty well,
I think&mdash;or maybe I dreamed I
know him; I'm not sure. Anyway,
I give him the two beers and wait
for him to get around to telling me
whatever is on his mind.</p>

<p>He goes through the same act
as before&mdash;only I can't be sure he
did go through the act or I
dreamed he did. "Beer for the
house," he yells.</p>

<p>"Take it easy," I cautions. "Take
it easy, Rabelais."</p>

<p>"You never called me by my
first name before, did you, Mike?"</p>

<p>I open my mouth to remind him
that he told me to back in 1953
and then I remember it is 1953.
That confuses me because I remember,
too, that in 1954 I was&mdash;or
maybe it's that I'm going to be&mdash;mayor.
I just close my mouth and
wait.</p>

<p>Rabelais takes his time. When
the early rush clears out, he gets
me off to one end of the bar and
says, "Sorry to keep you waiting,
Mike, but we have to do it all over
again."</p>

<p>"Then it wasn't a dream?"</p>

<p>"No dream," he says.</p>

<p>"But everything was going fine."</p>

<p>"Up to a point," he says. "Up
to the sixties."</p>

<p>Then he explains the way his
machine works. But all I get out of
what he says is that there's a law
of probability so he can't go back
and shoot his grandfather when the
old man is a boy or juggle stocks
in '47 to pay off and make him
rich in '53 and things like that.
That is why he wouldn't let us go
back into the past. He was afraid
we would do something to change
history and&mdash;bingo.</p>

<p>And he wouldn't let us go into
the future very far because up a
way the atom bomb gets loose and
it is awfully sad to see and dangerous
besides.</p>

<p>"That was in the sixties," he
says. "Or will be in the sixties. Only
I got it figured out so it won't be,
Mike."</p>

<p>It's over my head; I just keep on
waiting.</p>

<p>He explains that he made a pile
of dough in the near future by betting
on horse races and cleaning
out a few bookies and investing his
winnings in stocks he knew were
going up (and in fact they wouldn't
have gone up if he hadn't looked
into the future and known they
would so he could go back and
buy them) and anyway, he figured
the exact day it would be safe to
start and so he did.</p>

<p>"Only," he says, "we made a
mistake by making you mayor and
then congressman. I have it figured
out for you to be congressman right
from the start&mdash;in fifty-four. That
gives you two extra years of seniority
on Congress and so when the
chips are down you have a little
more pull."</p>

<p>"Fine," I says and start to take
off my apron.</p>

<p>"The thing is," he explains,
"there are a couple of lunkheads
in Congress that get super-patriotic
and they're the ones who cause
the trouble with the bomb getting
loose." He leans over the bar and
looks real serious at me. "And you,"
he goes on, "are the one who stops
them before they get started."</p>

<p>"Me? Me, Mike Murphy?"</p>

<p>"You," he says. "We just go on
a different time track from the one
we tried before. And this one ought
to work." He gives me his grin.
"You should see the history books
about the year 2000. You're a real
national hero, Mike."</p>

<p>I throw my apron into a corner
and roll down my sleeves. I'm
ready.</p>

<p>And it goes just like Rabelais
says. I pass up the mayor's job and
go straight to Congress. In my
third term I get a chance to cool
those two excitable characters&mdash;cool
them politically, that is, and
I do.</p>

<p>The only thing wrong is that
Rabelais never lets me go into the
future to read the history books
that tell what a great guy I was and
the things I did. So I'm never sure
I'm doing the right thing. Like I
tell him, how can I be sure what to
do if he won't let me read about
what I did?</p>
